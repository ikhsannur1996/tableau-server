# Tableau Server Backup Guide (Windows Server)

This guide outlines the steps for creating and scheduling backups for Tableau Server on a Windows Server environment. Backups are essential for safeguarding your data and ensuring disaster recovery readiness.

## Prerequisites

- Tableau Server is installed and operational on a Windows Server.
- Administrator access to the Windows Server.

## Tableau Server Backup Process

Follow these steps to create and schedule backups for Tableau Server:

### 1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator

Open the Command Prompt as an administrator. This is essential for executing commands with the required privileges.

### 2. Navigate to Tableau Server Bin Directory

Navigate to the Tableau Server bin directory using the following command:

```shell
cd "C:\Program Files\Tableau\Tableau Server\<version>\bin"
```

Replace `<version>` with the installed version of Tableau Server.

### 3. Schedule a Backup

Use the following command to schedule a backup:

```shell
tsm maintenance backup -f <backup-file-name> -sr <recurrence> -st <time-to-run> -sd <days-to-run> -sn <schedule-name>
```

- `<backup-file-name>`: Name for the backup file.
- `<recurrence>`: Recurrence frequency ("daily," "weekly," or "monthly").
- `<time-to-run>`: Time in 24-hour format (HH:MM) when the backup should run.
- `<days-to-run>`: Day(s) on which the backup should run (comma-separated list).
- `<schedule-name>`: Name for the backup schedule.

### 4. Example Backup Schedule

For instance, to schedule a weekly backup every Friday at 8:00 PM, use:

```shell
tsm maintenance backup -f friday-backup -sr weekly -st 20:00 -sd 5 -sn friday-backup
```

This will create backups every Friday at 8:00 PM and generate files named `<yyyy.mm.dd.hh.mm>-friday-backup.tsbak`.

### 5. Monitoring and Verification

Regularly verify the success of your scheduled backups by checking the generated backup files and their timestamps.

## Important Notes

- Ensure the backup directory has sufficient storage space.
- Adjust the backup file naming convention as needed.
- Separate backups for configuration and data directory ensure comprehensive disaster recovery.
- Document your backup and recovery procedures for future reference.
